Description:
    Provides methods to convert between Python AnnData objects and
    SingleCellExperiment objects. These are primarily intended for use by
    downstream Bioconductor packages that wrap Python methods for single-cell
    data analysis. It also includes functions to read and write H5AD files used
    for saving AnnData objects to disk.
